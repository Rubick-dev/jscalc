### Introduction  
Part of the Advanced Development challenges on #FCC, the challenge was to build a calculator using javascript or JS libraries. I decided to use vanilla JS and work completely off current knowledge.

### Instructions  
Its works like any typical calculator with a limit of 12 characters being displayed from either typing them in or the response exceeding this limit.
1. You can chain results from either using arithmatic operators or the equals response.
2. Hit clear to start again.
3. You can change arithmatic operators at anytime
4. Right display shows your current inputted text or the result of a arathmatic operation.
5. Left displays the running total as well as the selected arithmatic operator for the next compute.
  
### The Code / Tools used:    
1. HTML5 & CSS3 - heavy use of the CSS grid tremplating system. 
2. JavaScript (es5/6)
  
### Versions  
1.0 - Bug free although, I have not put in a library to correct the od JS math issues. This will come at a latter date after completing the certificate.
